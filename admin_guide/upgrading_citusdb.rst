Upgrading CitusDB
##################

This section describes how you can upgrade your existing CitusDB installation to a later version. The upgrade process depends on the version from which you are upgrading. If you are upgrading between minor versions (i.e. 4.0 to 4.1), then the upgrade process is simpler as minor version upgrades in CitusDB are binary compatible. If you are upgrading between major CitusDB versions, then you can use the pg_upgrade utility. In the sections below, we describe the upgrade process for both these cases.
