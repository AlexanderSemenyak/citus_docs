CitusDB Documentation
=====================================

Welcome to the documentation for CitusDB 4.0.1! CitusDB is hybrid operational and analytics
database for Big Data built on PostgreSQL. CitusDB scales out PostgreSQL across
a cluster of physical or virtual servers through sharding and replication. Its
advanced query engine then parallelizes incoming SQL queries across
these servers to enable real-time responses.

The documentation explains how you can install CitusDB and then provides 
instructions to design, build, query, and maintain your CitusDB cluster. 
It also includes a Reference section which provides quick information on several topics.
