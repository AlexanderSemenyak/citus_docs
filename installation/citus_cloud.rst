Managed Deployment
==================

In addition to installing Citus yourself, you can rent a fully managed
instance. "Citus-as-a-Service" is an easy way to provision and monitor a
high-availability cluster. We offer managed deployments on both the Microsoft
Azure platform, and Amazon Web Services.

.. NOTE::
   Update: We are no longer onboarding new users to Citus Cloud on AWS. The good news is, Citus is still available to you: as open source,
   as on-prem enterprise software, and in the cloud on Microsoft Azure, as a fully-integrated deployment option in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
