Managed Deployment
==================

One of the easiest ways to get started with Citus is to spin up a cluster in
the cloud on Azure. Citus is available as a built-in deployment option in the
`Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus)
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/hyperscale/>`_ managed
service.

To get started, you can take advantage of our Hyperscale (Citus) `quickstart
documentation
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-hyperscale-portal>`_,
or go straight to the `Azure Portal
<https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.PostgreSQLServer>`_ to provision a
Postgres server. (And if you don’t yet have an Azure subscription, just `create
a free Azure account <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>`_ first.)

.. NOTE::

  We are no longer onboarding new users to our previous managed service, Citus
  Cloud on AWS.
