User Guide

This section describes how CitusDB users can create, manipulate and query their distributed tables. We first begin by describing
basics of the CitusDB architecture, how it processes queries and handles
failures. We then discuss how users can create append and hash partitioned
tables and load data into them. We finally describe the different types of queries
CitusDB supports and how users can run them.
